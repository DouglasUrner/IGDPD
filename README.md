Game Prototype Examples in Unity and C# from Part III of 
[Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development (2nd edition)](http://book.prototools.net)
by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

The examples are being built during the winter of 2017-2018 as I evaluate the text for a high school game design and
programming class. The games were created using [Unity](https:unity3d.com) 2017.3.0f2 and version 2017.3 of the
[JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider) IDE. As the examples are completed they are turned into links to the
individual prototype folders.
